Thank you for trying 
Cloudflare Tunnel. Doing so, 
without a Cloudflare 
account, is a quick way to 
experiment and try it out. 
However, be aware that these 
account-less Tunnels have no 
uptime guarantee, are 
subject to the Cloudflare 
Online Services Terms of Use 
(https://www.cloudflare.com/w
ebsite-terms/), and 
Cloudflare reserves the 
right to investigate your 
use of Tunnels for 
violations of such terms. If 
you intend to use Tunnels in 
production you should use a 
pre-created named tunnel by 
following: https://developers
.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-on
e/connections/connect-apps
